Office Network Setup and Configuration Guide For Secure And Reliable Connectivity.

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of setting up and configuring an office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consists of routers, switches, PCs, and a wireless access point. The network is designed to provide secure and reliable connectivity for office employees.
The guide covers four main tasks:

1. Conducting a comprehensive security assessment and implementing basic security measures
2. Optimizing network performance using SNMP and Syslog monitoring and QoS settings
3. Implementing load balancing and failover mechanisms using OSPF
4. Developing and applying a network backup and recovery plan using TFTP

Each task includes detailed steps and explanations to help you configure and test the network.

Office Network Setup and Configuration Report

Introduction:

This report documents the setup and configuration of an office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to provide secure and reliable connectivity for office employees.

Task 1: Security Assessment and Implementation

- Conducted a comprehensive security assessment of the network
- Implemented basic security measures such as SSH, ACLs, and wireless security
- Configured a strong password for the router and enabled SSH remote access
- Created a local user for SSH access
- Configured an access control list (ACL) to restrict access to a specific network
- Set up wireless security using WPA2-PSK

Task 2: Network Performance Optimization

- Enabled SNMP monitoring on the router
- Enabled Syslog monitoring on the server
- Collected monitoring data and adjusted QoS settings to prioritize critical traffic like VoIP
- Configured QoS for VoIP traffic and applied it to the outgoing interface

Task 3: Load Balancing and Failover

- Set up redundant links between routers and switches
- Configured OSPF for load balancing and failover
- Tested failover by disconnecting the primary link and verifying traffic rerouting

Task 4: Network Backup and Recovery

- Enabled TFTP on the server
- Backed up the router configuration to the TFTP server
- Restored the configuration from the TFTP server after erasing the router's configuration
- Tested the backup and recovery process to ensure proper restoration of configurations
  

Conclusion:

This report documents the successful setup and configuration of an office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is secure, optimized for performance, and has load balancing and failover mechanisms in place. A network backup and recovery plan has also been implemented to ensure business continuity in case of network failures. 

Recommendations:

- Regularly review and update security measures to ensure network protection
- Continuously monitor network performance and adjust QoS settings as needed
- Test failover mechanisms regularly to ensure proper functioning
- Schedule regular backups of network configurations to ensure business continuity

Challenges faced during project:

1. Network security threats
2. Complex configuration
3. Performance optimization
4. Redundancy and failover
5. Backup and recovery

Solutions:

1. Firewalls and ACLs
2. Strong passwords and SSH
3. QoS and SNMP
4. OSPF and redundancy
5. Regular backups and TFTP

Summary Of Project:
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of setting up and configuring an office network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consists of routers, switches, PCs, and a wireless access point. The guide covers four main tasks: security assessment and implementation, network performance optimization, load balancing and failover, and network backup and recovery.
